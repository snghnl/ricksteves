                                    My wife and I had never been on any cruise
                                    before when we were invited by close friends
                                    to join them on a Viking River Cruise. Our
                                    close friend’s mother had chaperoned 8
                                    teenagers including him, my wife and I 50
                                    years ago this month and this trip was to
                                    fulfil a promise to return that we made back
                                    in 1966.<br />
                                    My wife and I have traveled to Europe a
                                    couple of times in the interim. As we always
                                    do when traveling, we flew close to the
                                    ground, making all the arrangements
                                    ourselves and staying pretty much off the
                                    beaten path. We knew the river cruise would
                                    be a different from the way we choose to
                                    travel, but we determined to make the best
                                    of it.<br />
                                    I’m writing this because I suspect a fair
                                    number of you here at Rick Steves are more
                                    like us and have never been on a cruise.
                                    Viking River Cruises has a fantastic
                                    marketing campaign and sure make compelling
                                    advertisements that appear on PBS and
                                    magazines like Smithsonian that we’re likely
                                    to read. As an atypical river cruise
                                    customer, I’d like to share some thoughts
                                    with the curious who are wondering if a
                                    river cruise would be for them.<br />
                                    We sailed down the Rhine from Basel,
                                    Switzerland to Amsterdam, Netherlands on the
                                    Viking Eir from July 15 to July 24,
                                    including a two day extension in Amsterdam.
                                    There were 187 passengers and 50 crew
                                    members on board. We were blessed with
                                    rainless but very warm weather the entire
                                    trip. The Rhine river level was optimum and
                                    the sail went off without a hitch.<br />
                                    Our shipboard experience was excellent. The
                                    Viking Eir is impeccably maintained and
                                    comfortable. Our room was spotless and
                                    cleaned twice a day. The entire staff worked
                                    overtime to make the trip pleasant and
                                    enjoyable. All meals were well prepared and
                                    I like their open seating concept; we got to
                                    make many new friends.<br />
                                    I think they missed the mark on both their
                                    included and optional excursions. It took
                                    four buses to cart us around and there was
                                    just one guide for an entire bus of 50. The
                                    included excursions were designed to fit
                                    between either breakfast and lunch or lunch
                                    and dinner on board. I often felt rushed. We
                                    were promised some free time, but this
                                    worked out to be at most and hour and
                                    usually much less. We only took one optional
                                    excursion (in place of the included one) and
                                    is was a big disappointment. We took the
                                    excursion up the Moselle River, which was
                                    primarily riding on the bus. It advertised
                                    two wine tastings. What we got was a hurried
                                    stop at a winery and two glasses of wine to
                                    taste. There was not much value in the extra
                                    100 euro we spent. <br />
                                    The most memorable times of the trip
                                    occurred during our free time pursuing
                                    experiences we planned ourselves. We rode a
                                    cable car from Rudesheim to the Niederwald
                                    Monument. Most of our time in Amsterdam was
                                    free and we took a canal ride and visited
                                    museums and street markets.<br />
                                    We are glad we joined our close friends for
                                    this trip and we certainly had a wonderful
                                    time. Viking did a lot of things right and
                                    it there were magic moments sitting on the
                                    upper deck at dusk with the river at our
                                    feet and the skylines of German towns in the
                                    distance. It was nice to unpack just once.
                                    However, I don’t think river cruising fits
                                    our lifestyle and personalities. We love the
                                    interaction we have had with the citizens of
                                    the countries we’ve visited in the past. On
                                    those trips we seek out restaurants
                                    frequented by locals. We stay at small
                                    B&amp;B’s, often in the homes or on the
                                    farms of empty nesters who rent out just a
                                    room or two. With a river cruise the only
                                    interaction is with your guide and the clerk
                                    at the shops where you buy souvenirs.<br /><br />
                                    I did a little research and found that a
                                    similar DIY trip, including airfare, hotels
                                    and rental car would have cost way less than
                                    half of what we spent. A similar Rick Steves
                                    tour would have cost less as well. <br />
                                    Viking makes their river cruises look
                                    compelling. However, if you subscribe to the
                                    Rick Steves philosophy of travel, think long
                                    and hard about if this is the experience you
                                    want to have.

                                        Thank you very much for this review,
                                        which confirms my belief that a river
                                        cruise is not for me and my husband. I
                                        always feel kind of sorry for the people
                                        following one of the river cruise guides
                                        through a major attraction. It must be
                                        extremely frustrating if you have any
                                        real interest in what you're seeing.
                                        That wine "tasting" sounds pretty cheesy
                                        for 100 Euros.

                                        DougMac,<br />
                                        Thanks for your thoughtful report. I
                                        have received the Viking River Cruise
                                        brochures and have a number of good
                                        friends who love them. I, however, have
                                        felt it would not fit my style of
                                        traveling. I don't want to be confined
                                        to eating 3 meals onboard leaving hardly
                                        any time for sightseeing in the
                                        countries you are visiting. It sounds
                                        good on paper - unpacking only once,
                                        seeing the sunset while relaxing on the
                                        boat deck. I like the RS tours (I've
                                        been on 2 and the 3rd is coming up in
                                        October) because you have many more
                                        opportunities to spend time "on the
                                        ground" in Europe and to learn about the
                                        history and culture. Also, RS gives you
                                        ample free time in which you can design
                                        your own itinerary to satisfy your own
                                        curiosity and interests and passions.
                                        Plus, a big plus in my book, is the RS
                                        guides help guide you to become an
                                        independent traveler so that you can
                                        come back and dive more deeply into an
                                        area that you enjoy.<br />
                                        Thanks again,<br />

                                        I'll echo traylaparks in thanking you
                                        for this report. I've been pretty sure
                                        that our diy trips cost half or less
                                        than an organized tour, and we stay at
                                        places with some charm and eat well.
                                        It's important to us to get deep into
                                        the places we visit. An hour for most
                                        sites just won't satisfy. A friend has
                                        been singing the praises of river
                                        cruising, including the one you just
                                        took; and my instinct has been that it's
                                        not for us. You've erased any doubts.

                                        Viking river cruises because they are SO
                                        GOOD at marketing (that scene of the

                                        My DH and I (late 40's) took a Viking
                                        River Cruise a few years ago and LOVED
                                        it. In general, we do our travel
                                        arrangements ourselves, but we had never
                                        been to France and don't speak the
                                        language and thought this might be a
                                        great way to get an overview. Since
                                        then, we've been back to France twice
                                        and plan to go again next year. But the
                                        Viking guides were fabulous and the
                                        places we went we had enough time to
                                        take the tour and then do a bit on our
                                        own. It is expensive and it's not for
                                        everyone, but we will definitely go
                                        again to places like China, where we
                                        would be too timid to go on our own, but
                                        would like to visit. It was great just
                                        to have someone else handle the
                                        logistics, have great meals and have
                                        different options for touring.

                                        So many people love European river
                                        cruises, but dollar for dollar ocean
                                        cruises are a much better value.<br /><br />
                                        Last August, we took an 11 day Baltic
                                        cruise that included Germany, Tallin,
                                        St. Petersburg, Helsinki, Stockholm and
                                        back to Copenhagen. We flew to Oslo and
                                        took a Norway in a Nutshell tour to
                                        Bergen.<br />
                                        The end of April, 2016, we flew into
                                        Rome for 3 days and got on a 12 day
                                        cruise to Malta, thru the Greek Isles to
                                        Turkey and to Venice.<br />
                                        For what a one week river cruise cost,
                                        we spent less on both cruises--including
                                        our two flights to Europe.

                                        I'm glad to hear you have found my post
                                        of some benefit. Here's a point or two
                                        of clarification.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        While we didn't have much free time as
                                        part of the included excursions, most
                                        days we had the afternoon free for our
                                        own exploration. The ships usually dock
                                        within walking distance of the town,
                                        therefore it's easy to just walk off the
                                        ship and into town. At Strasbourg and
                                        Heidelberg, you could either return to
                                        the ship after the morning included
                                        excursion or stay in town and catch one
                                        of the three shuttles they provided in
                                        the afternoon. If you wanted to stay
                                        even later, you could catch a taxi back
                                        to the ship.
                                    </p>

                                        The Black Forest Excursion was shorter
                                        than I would have liked and since it was
                                        about an hour away there was no way to
                                        return. Viking did offer an all day
                                        Black Forest trip, but at $150 euros
                                        each we opted not to take it. That's OK,
                                        we'll return to the Black Forest when we
                                        win the lottery and travel to the BMW,
                                        Mercedes or Porsche factory to pick up
                                        our new car (I'm leaning towards the BMW
                                        8i). ;-)

                                        melodyesch, I understand your
                                        apprehension for going it alone in an
                                        exotic location. Be thinking of my older
                                        son. He is one week into a two week
                                        business trip to mainland China! He
                                        pretty much had to make the plans by
                                        himself and he's navigating from city to
                                        city on his own!

                                        Your post made me think of a couple we
                                        met in Amsterdam this summer. They
                                        shared they were just off of a River
                                        Cruise. They said that they often take
                                        ocean cruises and also enjoyed their
                                        river cruise experience. I was a little
                                        surprised when they shared that they
                                        were the youngest people aboard their
                                        particular river cruise and they were in
                                        their late 60's. They certainly aren't
                                        old, but it did make we wonder just who
                                        all takes river cruises if everyone else
                                        was older.

                                        We're in our late 40s and I have thought
                                        that river cruises look like a great
                                        option for when we are incapable of
                                        going it alone or even on a Rick Steves
                                        tour. I still want to be able to travel
                                        and appreciate that there are still ways
                                        to make it happen even a bit later in
                                        life. We won't all be able to continue
                                        to travel like a local forever,
                                        unfortunately. Cruising through Europe
                                        with a glass of wine and a sunset might
                                        be just what I need when I'm in my own
                                        sunset. :D<br />
                                        Ocean cruises with 5000+ people on
                                        board? Never.

                                        Doug, thanks so much for your thoughtful
                                        report! We get brochures from Viking all
                                        the time, and it may work for us
                                        sometime down the road if/when it
                                        becomes more difficult for us to go it
                                        alone but not at this point. I would
                                        never knock cruises as I know lots and
                                        lots of people enjoy them - and it's
                                        THEIR money and their trip, not mine -
                                        but one-day stops don't do it for us.
                                        Heck, 2-3 days in major European cities
                                        isn't nearly enough, and we'd be
                                        miserable with just one afternoon or one
                                        day on our own.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        We're also not big on having to follow a
                                        group around, and having a schedule
                                        dictated to us. It's too much fun to do
                                        what we want, when we want to, for as
                                        long or not as we want to so I guess
                                        we're just lousy tour material!
                                    </p>

                                        I appreciate your posting to give us the
                                        inside view of the river cruises. My
                                        husband &amp; I both have said we
                                        wouldn't be interested - too independent
                                        and love eating with the locals, etc. as
                                        you mentioned. Being in a bus with 50
                                        people sounds like a horrible vacation
                                        moment, especially thinking about how
                                        much vacation time would be "waiting -
                                        waiting to load, waiting to unload,
                                        waiting during the tour, etc. - yuck! :
                                        )
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        We know some people who have taken those
                                        cruises and love them. I consider that
                                        it's better that they're able to enjoy
                                        Europe in that mode than not at all.

                                        I have been on three Viking cruises, and
                                        I am going on the fourth at the end of
                                        August (sounds like the one you were
                                        just on). I have been on as many
                                        independent trips. There are better and
                                        worse aspects to both:
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        Advantages<br />
                                        * You have a hotel that moves around
                                        with you. Usually you dock in the center
                                        of town.<br />
                                        * One payment covers most of your
                                        travel, lodging, and meals.<br />
                                        * You can be sure of dealing with people
                                        who speak English. <br />
                                        * Your tours are arranged and conducted
                                        by people who know the area.<br />
                                        * If you aren’t sure whether you want to
                                        spend much time in a region, you can get
                                        a good sampling of different cities. If
                                        you find some you like, you can go back
                                        on your own.<br />
                                        * The food is good.<br />
                                        * Someone else deals with your airline
                                        reservations, luggage, and local
                                        transportation. You won't be lugging
                                        your bags.<br />
                                        * Because you travel mostly at night,
                                        your waking hours can be used for
                                        fun.<br />
                                        * The times when you do travel during
                                        the day are more scenic, and you’re not
                                        sitting in a seat for hours at a
                                        time.<br />
                                        * You sometimes have very interesting
                                        dinner conversations with people you
                                        would not have met otherwise.<br />
                                        * The staff is helpful and will try to
                                        take care of your special requests.<br />
                                        * You're always free to skip the group
                                        tours and go off on your own.

                                        Disadvantages<br />
                                        * You have to conform to someone else’
                                        schedule. <br />
                                        * The tours always take place in large
                                        groups. <br />
                                        * You often find yourself in a group
                                        surrounded by other groups.<br />
                                        * If you have some kind of special
                                        interest, you may not have time for it,
                                        or you will have to spend less time than
                                        you would like.<br /><br />
                                        * At worst (but not often), some of the
                                        locations and entertainment are
                                        uninteresting or just plain tacky.<br />
                                        * Tours seldom go to museums, except
                                        perhaps art museums.<br />
                                        * When you’re thrown together with a lot
                                        of other people, it’s inevitable that
                                        some of them will get on your nerves.<br />
                                        * Usually the boat stocks only one good
                                        draft beer.<br />
                                        * It’s expensive. (That said, so is
                                        independent traveling.) You need to plan
                                        ahead and look for deals.<br />
                                        * Much of the evening entertainment is a
                                        write-off.<br />
                                        * While the food is good, it’s prepared
                                        by the same staff every night. You don’t
                                        get the adventure of dining in local
                                        restaurants, unless you forgo the on
                                        board meals that you’ve already paid
                                        for.

                                        Caveat: I have a general bias against
                                        cruises mainly because I'm 44 and really
                                        like active, independent travel. Having
                                        said that, I'd do a cruise where it's
                                        the best or only option - Alaska,
                                        Galapagos Islands, Norwegian fiords, and
                                        Patagonia region in Argentina. A friend
                                        of mine went on the Viking Waterways of
                                        the Tsars cruise (Russia and Ukraine)
                                        which, truth be told, sounded fantastic.
                                        The cultural activities and knowledge
                                        imparted on that cruise sounded
                                        extraordinary, and I think that's the
                                        kind of place where linguistic barriers
                                        (cyrillic alphabet and difficult
                                        language) to do-it-yourself travel make
                                        a cruise option quite attractive. This
                                        is not so much the case in (I would
                                        argue) easy to travel places throughout
                                        Europe like the trip referenced above.
                                        Viking has the slickest advertising and
                                        prices to go with it - from the outside,
                                        it does look tempting but for all the
                                        "cons" previously mentioned. Thanks for
                                        posting your experience.

                                        Thank you for your post. We started our
                                        European travels after my retirement. We
                                        combined a river cruise (Avalon
                                        Waterways) with RS do it yourself. It
                                        was a perfect place for us to start. We
                                        enjoyed our cruise from Amsterdam to
                                        Basel. We enjoyed meeting everyone on
                                        our ship, making many friends from
                                        Austrailia and Shanghai as well as the
                                        USA. We didn't enjoy having to follow a
                                        guide around but soon figured out we
                                        could just skip the tours and enjoy our
                                        day on our own. When we arrived in Basel
                                        we picked up a rental car and our RS
                                        tour book and spent 9 amazing days in
                                        Switzerland. We learned that travel in
                                        Europe on your own isn't that difficult.
                                        The following year I was still a little
                                        nervous so we took RS My Way tour of
                                        Italy. We absolutely loved every minute
                                        of that trip. We also gained confidence
                                        to be independent! Last year we spent 5
                                        weeks in England and Scotland and this
                                        spring we spent a month in France. Using
                                        RS tour books we had all the tools we
                                        needed! Plus our 4 to 5 week of travel
                                        cost about the same as a 9 day River
                                        cruise! We are definitely independent
                                        travelers now and spending more time
                                        meeting locals and loving every minute!

                                        My husband have decided, (he is 78 and I
                                        am 74) that when we can no longer carry
                                        our suitcases up three flights of stairs
                                        we may start taking cruises. Or maybe
                                        not. When we travel we have the good
                                        fortune of being able to stay in Europe
                                        for two months at a time. I'm afraid a
                                        week or two would never be enough for
                                        us. We do travel as frugally as possible
                                        and rent apartments when we can so we
                                        can save our meal money for a worthwhile
                                        meal at a good restaurant once a day. We
                                        have loved what we have learned in
                                        traveling and have RS to thank for it.
                                        God bless Rick Steves, although we have
                                        never taken one of his tours, we have a
                                        library full of his books.

                                        I see some of you think that river
                                        cruising might be a good alternative
                                        later on. My 90 year old step
                                        father-in-law and mother-in-law think
                                        the same.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        Here is some things to consider. Almost
                                        all the cruising was done at night. The
                                        exceptions were one late afternoon, the
                                        morning we sailed the Middle Rhine and
                                        the morning before we arrived at
                                        Kinderdiik.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        We carried our iPhones (in airplane
                                        mode) and checked the built in Health
                                        app. We averaged walking 6.5 miles a day
                                        that week, with two days at 10 miles. I
                                        guess you could stay on board, but
                                        rarely was there much to see from the
                                        dock.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        Dav did mention another downside. 98% of
                                        our fellow cruisers were wonderful
                                        people. There was one guy who couldn't
                                        hold his liquor and was loud and
                                        obnoxious the first couple of days.
                                        Finally when he was drunk and wouldn't
                                        go back to the room, his wife dressed
                                        him down in the lobby! Luckily that
                                        straightened him up. There was another
                                        jerk who screamed at the staff when
                                        another Viking tied up side by side.
                                        Also, we had a nice light classical
                                        recital one evening. This guy walked in
                                        to the lounge in the middle of a song
                                        and started talking loudly to a friend.
                                        He was shushed by a number of guests,
                                        but kept on talking. Finally another
                                        guest told him if he wanted to talk he
                                        should go somewhere else. After the
                                        concert the jerk came over and
                                        threatened the other guy! Some Americans
                                        can sure act boorish.

                                        Jerry&amp;Stelly you hit the nail on the
                                        head. I expect to seriously consider a
                                        river cruise when I can't handle the
                                        rigors of a train ride. But at 67 it's a
                                        few years off, God willing.

                                        We have friends who have lived overseas
                                        in Asia and South American, as well as
                                        traveled extensively around the world.
                                        Now one is ill, so they are happy with
                                        river cruises and agencies that
                                        transport them door-to-door. There is a
                                        right time for everything and everyone.

                                        I was on a Viking River Cruise in April
                                        2014, on the Rhine from Amsterdam to
                                        Basel. All the previous posts from you
                                        all here in this thread sound accurate
                                        to me. IMHO the bottom line is how much
                                        adventure (good &amp; bad), stress,
                                        independence do you want in your
                                        vacation and what’s you budget. The
                                        local tour guides in each city were
                                        almost always great and I would love to
                                        have spent more time with each of them.
                                        I’m sure there are less expensive river
                                        cruise operators but you usually get
                                        what you pay for. I was 55 years old on
                                        that trip and I think only 11 other
                                        passengers were younger than I was.
                                        Usually as you get older you have more
                                        $$ for a vacation, maybe that’s why so
                                        many older folks are on these more
                                        pricey cruises.

                                        Taking the cable car up to the
                                        Niederwald Denkmal is a great way to get
                                        a view of the Rhine and valley., very
                                        scenic. Walking back down takes a bit
                                        over half an hour.

                                        We did a cruise down the Danube from
                                        Budapest to Nuremberg and bused to
                                        Prague for two more days. We loved it
                                        but won't be taking a river cruise again
                                        until we can no longer carry our cases
                                        and walk six to ten miles a day. While I
                                        loved it all, it was very expensive. I'd
                                        rather spend less, see more, and stay
                                        longer on my own or on an escorted tour.
                                        We avoid large tour groups preferring
                                        the smaller group tours. We sailed on
                                        AMA Waterways. But...I loved our small
                                        boat cruise down the Amazon and
                                        Celebrity Xpedition in the Galapagos!

                                        Yes these river cruises are expensive
                                        but Viking always has a period each
                                        season where the cruises are deeply
                                        discounted to 2 for 1 and flights are
                                        also bargain priced. You need to shop
                                        early to take advantage of these reduced
                                        fares.

                                        I might be the odd duck but I find the
                                        personalities of accommodations we stay
                                        in during multi-destinational trips to
                                        be part of the fun! With a few
                                        exceptions, our European stays haven't
                                        been in run-of-the-mill, cookie-cutter
                                        rooms, and I've enjoyed their individual
                                        quirks. Kind of like people?

                                        Granted, I wouldn't want to be checking
                                        in and out with the frequency of
                                        location changes involved with cruise
                                        itineraries but we're also leaning
                                        towards longer stays as our
                                        spring-chicken days become ever more
                                        ancient history. HA!

                                        I generally agree with the OP about ways
                                        of travel and generally plan trips
                                        myself, take tours or do some
                                        combination. However, because of
                                        circumstances I've taken 2 river
                                        cruises. The first was from St.
                                        Petersburg to Moscow. As I don't like
                                        traveling totally alone, I signed up for
                                        the cruise as it started the day that I
                                        was "done" in St. Petersburg. The
                                        food/entertainment/guides etc. on that
                                        cruise were mediocre but acceptable.
                                        After one night in St. Petersburg we
                                        headed down to Moscow. The boat stopped
                                        daily and we generally spent 4-6 hours
                                        touring small towns with interesting
                                        histories. I only felt one stop was too
                                        "touristy" and we ended up in Moscow. I
                                        did take an optional excursion in Moscow
                                        (the city at night) and got my money's
                                        worth. So not my favorite trip, but a
                                        good experience. The other tour was a
                                        cruise of the Nile which I think was and
                                        still is the best way to see Egypt.
                                        After seeing Cairo, we flew to Abu
                                        Simbel and then took a cruise ship to
                                        Aswan.... we stopped daily on Lake
                                        Nasser for about 3 hours to see temples
                                        and tombs which were part of the Nubian
                                        Temple projects.... very few tourists
                                        and a great experience. We transferred
                                        ships in Aswan and did the usual cruise
                                        down to Luxor with stops on the way. For
                                        a short tour, I think it was a good
                                        sampling of Egypt. Other than that, I
                                        will be hard pressed to take another
                                        cruise until I am too old to travel the
                                        way I like.

                                        like a good option if your party
                                        includes someone who is less mobile.

                                        Thanks for this report. Like several
                                        others have already said, this confirms
                                        that river cruising is indeed right for
                                        some travelers - and that it's not for
                                        me at this time.
                                    </p>

                                        Great forum! We've now taken 2 river
                                        cruises on AMAWaterways and we NEVER had
                                        50 in a tour group. If you'd like to try
                                        a river cruise and I must add there is
                                        nothing so lovely as waking up on the
                                        Main River while gracefully floating and
                                        listening to the wild birds do their
                                        morning song and having a cup of tea.( I
                                        actually saw and heard a cuckoo bird one
                                        morning) We also experienced the 64
                                        locks from Amsterdam to Budapest and
                                        marveled at the wonder of the
                                        Main-Danube canal, including locks 81
                                        feet tall- incredible. Going over the
                                        continental divide. That was our second
                                        cruise and a rather long one..(14 days)
                                        In my opinion a bit too long. Ever
                                        wonder if your head would be cut off
                                        sitting on the top deck and going under
                                        one of the low bridges in Germany (our
                                        crew said we could stay, but must sit
                                        down.. omg, this was a thrill ride!)
                                        <br />
                                        Yes, I was definitely tired of the food
                                        on board, but not because it was bad...
                                        just so much. Actually hunted out the
                                        best burger in Passau, Germany... needed
                                        a burger fix! But I must admit they
                                        served the very BEST soups I have EVER
                                        had- both cruises! WOW!<br />
                                        And you can possible look for those
                                        other treasures to do without the other
                                        cruisers... but don't book it ahead of
                                        being in the country as with nature and
                                        the river, schedules change. We were
                                        lucky and I found on google one day
                                        while gently on the danube that the
                                        night we were in Vienna was one of only
                                        5 performances of the "Tribute to
                                        Vienna" where we could see the Spanish
                                        Riding School, hear an ensemble from the
                                        Vienna Symphony and a vocalist from the
                                        Vienna Opera.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        why did we take 2 cruises? Because, I
                                        wanted to have less stress and save my
                                        marriage. No rental cars, no fighting
                                        with the language, etc. and what we
                                        gained was some very lovely friends, the
                                        stressless mode of travel and many
                                        cities I may never have visited.<br />
                                        You can meet local people but you may
                                        have to work at it, just like when
                                        traveling on your own. I spent an hour
                                        with a wonderful group of people in a
                                        small town in Germany sipping the great
                                        Rhine river wine. <br />
                                        And please do not think you can do a
                                        river cruise if you can't walk. Now, AMA
                                        separates their groups to Active,
                                        Regular and Gentle walkers... so if you
                                        are not able to walk or stand on cobble
                                        stones PLEASE be a gentle walker and not
                                        slow the group down.<br /><br />
                                        However, what I missed is the local food
                                        (AMA had no cost options for culinary
                                        tours) So I signed up for most of
                                        these.. Like making Slovakia specialties
                                        with a chef in the Sheraton in
                                        Bratislava. My hubbie was able to take 3
                                        biking tours (very small numbers in
                                        these). All included in our huge first
                                        price, but like someone said that was
                                        our choice.<br />
                                        I would do another river cruise but will
                                        be hard pressed to do a ocean cruise
                                        again. We did the Baltic with Holland
                                        America last August and couldn't get off
                                        the ship fast enough. No personal
                                        interaction, very unlike our river
                                        cruises. But was an adequate and cost
                                        effect way to see the Baltic capitals.
                                        Loved every port. <br />
                                        Now in about 30 days taking our first RS
                                        tour to the Adriatic. I must admit the
                                        bus portion of the trip seems the least
                                        fav.<br />
                                        We have lived and traveled extensively

                                        Thanks so much to the OP and everyone
                                        who added comments. I've been toying
                                        with the idea of a river cruise for a
                                        while, enticed by those lovely Viking
                                        ads, and thinking of a Rhine river
                                        cruise. But my reservations are exactly
                                        what has been highlighted--touring in
                                        large groups, eating the boat food every
                                        day (even if it is fine, still not the
                                        same as local places), possibly mediocre
                                        evening "entertainment." The comments
                                        have given much to think about. It does
                                        seem as if these might be better at a
                                        time when less active travel is more
                                        attractive, and that's not where we are
                                        now. Some of the posters were on cruises
                                        other than Viking--was that experience
                                        any different? and are any of the ships
                                        smaller? Besides the Rhine cruise, I've
                                        also looked at small boat trips in the
                                        Greek isles, on ships with only 50 or so
                                        passengers, which seems like a better
                                        size. Larger ocean cruises are
                                        absolutely unappealing--we looked into
                                        ones for Alaska, but lost our nerve
                                        contemplating a crowded ship that seemed
                                        to us to be a huge floating Las
                                        Vegas-style hotel--wonderful for those
                                        who like it, but not our style!

                                        Lois, On our last trip the cruise only
                                        had 90 people on it. We never had more
                                        than 15 people in any group tour. The
                                        audio system they use allows you to
                                        listen to the guides (who are all local
                                        people) and wander around a bit. Or you
                                        are not required to go on a tour in any
                                        city you visit. Just know when you must
                                        be back on board. In Vienna we had the
                                        entire day and some others on my tour
                                        used Rick Steves audio guide and did
                                        their own things. <br />
                                        Our food on AMA waterways was excellent.
                                        Always choices, but what I didn't have
                                        to do is research restaurants in each
                                        town, make reservations, etc. They also
                                        try to do regional selections .. like in
                                        Germany we had a whole roasted suckling
                                        pig! My only hardship was that for 14
                                        days in a row we had a 4 course meal
                                        every night... not my normal way of
                                        eating. But the soups were
                                        phenomenal!<br /><br />
                                        The sights from the river are some you
                                        would never see if traveling by coach or
                                        car. And it puts you back in time, as
                                        river travel was the first travelways of
                                        Europe. The Rhine river is great and
                                        you'll see more castle ruins, Take a
                                        short river cruise in the beginning or
                                        end of the season, cost is lower and
                                        less people on the boats. I have not
                                        traveled with Viking, but have
                                        definitely witness their tour groups of
                                        25+, when we had much less in ours.
                                        Another benefit of the company we went
                                        with is they offer many biking tours. My
                                        husband had participated in these and
                                        Loved them!

                                        Thanks, tgreen, I'm glad to hear about
                                        less-advertised alternatives. I'll look
                                        at AMA waterways.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        I know what you mean about researching
                                        restaurants--it is time-consuming and
                                        one never knows how reliable reviews
                                        really are, even from trusted sources
                                        like RS, although I've never had a bad
                                        meal from a recommendation from his
                                        guides. The temptation to eat much more
                                        than usual is a hazard of travel in
                                        Europe, I've found, but a hardship I'm
                                        willing to endure!
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        Since definitions of early and late
                                        season are sometimes flexible, how would
                                        you describe them? We tend to avoid
                                        summer in any event because of crowds
                                        and likely hot weather. And since we're
                                        no longer limited to school vacation
                                        periods, there's no reason to go in the
                                        summer anyway!

                                        Early is April or May, Late is end of
                                        October into November. We did our first
                                        cruise October 2014 and was in Prague on
                                        Halloween. You can get lucky and have a
                                        very warm week or need hats and gloves.
                                        It turned cold the last weeks in October
                                        that year so we needed double layers and
                                        hats, scarves, but not objectionable at
                                        all. The tourist season is fairly over
                                        and other than not being able to use the
                                        pool on the top deck, sitting out
                                        bundled up is quite pleasant sipping on
                                        a hot beverage while gently moving down
                                        the river. Our second cruise was May
                                        2016 and started in Amsterdam. The day
                                        we went thru the Rhine River Gorge
                                        started with lazy fog, which added to
                                        the ambiance of the River. The ship
                                        provides plenty of blankets to wrap up
                                        in, but then the sun broke thru and was
                                        gorgeous. But do your research as the
                                        spring can be rainy and remember all the
                                        mountains wash into those rivers, so
                                        water levels could be high and then your
                                        schedule may change some. If you want to
                                        do something completely different
                                        consider a Christmas Market Cruise.

                                        tgreen, I'm thinking of trying to see
                                        the tulips next spring, so might be in
                                        Amsterdam in late April. That could
                                        combine with a Rhine cruise, since they
                                        often start there, but that would be
                                        really early since I think the tulips
                                        are done by early May. Were you able to
                                        see them before your trip this spring?
                                        The other choice would be late Sept or
                                        early Oct., which would probably be very
                                        pretty. Not being able to use a pool
                                        deck wouldn't trouble either of us,
                                        whether in May or fall. I did take a
                                        look at AMA cruises on the Rhine, and
                                        will think about that once I return from
                                        the RS Village Italy trip I'll be on in
                                        September.

                                    <p>
                                        We took the AMAWaterways Tulip Time Tour
                                        a couple of years ago. It was great and
                                        the flowers were so beautiful! I have a
                                        friend who is a travel agent and she
                                        highly recommends AMA. She told us that
                                        all of the river cruise lines have the
                                        same size ship, but they all have
                                        different passenger capacities. Our AMA
                                        cruise was full and only had 125
                                        passengers.

                                    <p>Stephen,</p>

                                    <p>
                                        Thanks for the info about AMA. I'm sure
                                        the tulip cruise would be lovely, but I
                                        think I'd probably stay on land for
                                        Amsterdam and environs. I had planned to
                                        do the RS tour that went to Brussels and
                                        Holland last spring with some friends,
                                        but as our departure was very soon after
                                        the bombings in Brussels, our friends
                                        weren't comfortable traveling there. So
                                        didn't get to tulip time this year, but
                                        I thought I could try again next,
                                        without a tour, and try a Rhine cruise
                                        later. But I will definitely check out
                                        AMA.

                                        It sounds like the Viking River cruises
                                        have changed a lot since we took them
                                        several 10 to 15 years ago. There were
                                        no buses. The ship carrying around 120
                                        passengers tied up in a town or city for
                                        most of the day. A walking tour would be
                                        offered. You could return to the ship
                                        easily if you wished as it was moored
                                        nearby. Lots of independent time. We
                                        always ate lunch in tne town or city.
                                        The food onboard and tours in cities
                                        were not of a high level, all rather
                                        pedestrian. No toiletries were provided
                                        by Viking either. We looked at it as a
                                        moving hotel.<br />
                                        A few years ago we went on a AMA
                                        Waterways Mekong cruise which was our
                                        favorite one and everything was at a
                                        higher level than our earlier Viking
                                        River Cruises. We visited places we
                                        never would have been able to see on our
                                        own.

                                        Suki, I can't read again through all of
                                        the responses again but I do know that
                                        unusually low water levels on some of
                                        the rivers within the last few years
                                        necessitated changes in docking
                                        itineraries. The boats (for more
                                        companies than just Viking) had to tie
                                        up at more remote locations, and load
                                        passengers onto buses to access some of
                                        the cities.

                                        Thank you for your input and experience.
                                        We have cruised big ships in the past,
                                        but now having traveled on our own we
                                        would never take a cruise through Europe
                                        unless it was the Fjords, Greek Isles
                                        etc. or when we are just too old to do
                                        it on our own.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        My parents have always cruised. My dad
                                        took me on a British Isle cruise after
                                        my mom died. We stopped three places in
                                        Ireland, three places in Scotland, we
                                        saw Wales and Guernsey Island as well as
                                        Normandy. It was an interesting
                                        experience after touring Europe on our
                                        own. We did "see" a lot. And, for
                                        someone who doesn't know the difference,
                                        they love it and think that is what
                                        Europe is all about (IMHO) But, "seeing"
                                        it and experiencing it are two different
                                        things in my book. On the cruise with my
                                        dad we forgot what we had seen the day
                                        before, and we had no real experiences
                                        to hang our hat on. When we travel on
                                        our own it is a slower pace and I can
                                        recall every place we visited and what
                                        we did, who we talked with, and
                                        experiences that stay with you.

                                        I've wondered if a river cruise would be
                                        any different than the cruise with my
                                        dad, and your experience just confirms
                                        that for me. I had someone once tell me
                                        that on a cruise you are in America
                                        while on board and in Europe when you
                                        get off. Not enough of Europe for me!
                                        Thanks for sharing your story!

                                        As someone who has been happily taking
                                        independent trips and river cruises on
                                        alternate years for the past decade, I
                                        think that the differences can be
                                        exaggerated. Yes, on a cruise you do
                                        have a home base that is more like
                                        "America" (although the crew on Viking
                                        boats is usually polyglot, and
                                        predominantly German). And, yes, you do
                                        have to conform to the schedule of when
                                        the boat arrives and leaves. Beyond
                                        that, though, you're free to do what you
                                        want. You can skip all of the group
                                        tours if that strikes your fancy. You
                                        can dine where you like, at least while
                                        the boat is docked. You're the customer,
                                        after all. You are in charge.
                                    </p>

                                        I'll be leaving for a Rhine cruise int
                                        two weeks. Next year, we're probably
                                        going to tackle the Baltic states on our
                                        own.

                                        We've never done a RS tour - although
                                        wish we had back in our younger, poorer
                                        days - but use the site and travel books
                                        extensively. We've also traveled as part
                                        of our careers. We took our first river
                                        cruise 2 years ago on the Rhone with
                                        Tauck. Have since taken their
                                        Rhine/Moselle cruise and signed up for
                                        another next year. Two points to
                                        make.<br />
                                        While I can appreciate that independent
                                        travelers might not enjoy a river cruise
                                        or think they are too expensive, for us
                                        its the cheaper option. That is compared
                                        to divorce proceedings or a murder
                                        trial. I can't imagine weeks in Europe
                                        dealing with all travel details and my
                                        husband seeing the prices and arguing
                                        about them. We appreciate having all the
                                        costs paid well before the trip and all
                                        the details taken care of. We're active
                                        60+ and want an active tour. If you make
                                        the effort you can put in 5-10 miles of
                                        walking a day. Evenings are pretty low
                                        key with maybe a singer or trivia quiz
                                        in the lounge. Most evenings after a
                                        long day with a long dinner and several
                                        drinks, we're ready to turn in and wind
                                        down to start over on another busy
                                        day.<br /><br />
                                        Secondly, there are differences between
                                        the river cruise companies. I would have
                                        to be given an extremely good price to
                                        go Viking. The higher priced all
                                        inclusive companies like Tauck truly
                                        deliver a wonderful vacation. No
                                        tipping, no extra excursion costs, no
                                        extra costs for drinks, and smaller
                                        group sizes. Taucks biggest ships only
                                        hold 130 and their older ships will be
                                        undergoing changes starting this year
                                        that reduce them to under 100. We never
                                        had a problem with a too big group and
                                        the local guides have been wonderful.
                                        Don't judge all cruises by Viking in
                                        spite of their great ads.

                                        I guess I'm too Scottish. If I don't
                                        take advantage of the meals and the
                                        tours, what am I paying $800+ a day for?
                                        I could stay at 4 star hotels and hire a
                                        chauffer for that amount of money!

                                        Now you're taking the discussion in a
                                        different direction. The previous posts
                                        did not involve mission work or pig
                                        pens. Sure, if you want that activity,
                                        you aren't going to find it on a cruise;
                                        but then, neither will most independent
                                        trips include it.
                                    </p>

                                        As it happens, I don't entirely
                                        subscribe to the Rick Steves philosophy
                                        of travel. I find his guidebooks and
                                        videos useful, but that doesn't mean I
                                        have to think like him in every respect.
                                        For that matter, Rick seems to spend a
                                        lot of time in cathedrals and art
                                        museums himself.

                                        My most recent comments were in reaction
                                        to the "oh, it's so American" and "maybe
                                        it's okay for disabled old people" posts
                                        above. A river cruise is a good way to
                                        get your lodging, transportation, and
                                        basic meals squared away. It doesn't
                                        commit you to be herded around or
                                        isolated from places you visit. Not
                                        being Scottish, I'm not pinching every
                                        farthing. I'm willing to forego some of
                                        the activities if the whole package is
                                        useful to me.

                                            a different direction. The previous
                                            posts did not involve mission work
                                            or pig pens. Sure, if you want that
                                            activity, you aren't going to find
                                            it on a cruise; but then, neither

                                        Sorry, my intent was to give readers a
                                        better idea of our perspective regarding
                                        travel. I'm reminded of the financial
                                        planning commercial that showed an
                                        archeological dig in a dusty in
                                        windblown desert. A sweat drenched young
                                        man turns to his companion and says: "I
                                        can't wait until I retire." The equally
                                        sweat drenched older gentleman replied:
                                        "I AM retired."
                                    </p>

                                        We gladly forego comfort and luxury for
                                        a more intimate experience whenever we
                                        travel. That factors in my impression of
                                        our river cruise. My post was aimed at
                                        helping folks who are of a like mind who
                                        have never taken a river cruise, but are
                                        curious about the experience.

                                        I went on a Viking River Cruise in 2012.
                                        It was my first cruise of any type and I
                                        think that influenced my negative view
                                        of my experience. I loved the cruising
                                        and unpacking once for 14 days. The food
                                        was good, but it is like college-you get
                                        tired of any food from the same kitchen
                                        after several days. I liked the
                                        excursions when we could tie up right
                                        next to the village or town in the case
                                        of Cologne and not have to be herded
                                        into buses. However, most travelers were
                                        married couples between 75 and 85 and
                                        even though I was in my 60's they
                                        preferred to socialize with other
                                        couples and when I would politely ask if
                                        I could join them at a meal or in the
                                        lounge they would tell me all the seats
                                        were reserved. My stateroom attendant
                                        was very nice, but when I told her I
                                        only needed her to clean once a day the
                                        head housekeeper heard about it and came
                                        to my door and literally scolded me (and
                                        since she was married to the Captain
                                        there was nothing I could do about her
                                        rudeness.) When the grey water backed up
                                        and my room smelled like a sewer there
                                        was no apology-just keep a wet bath mat
                                        over the shower drain and keep your
                                        windows open and it will be gone in 48
                                        hours! And, being a RS travel type
                                        person, the required tip (especially
                                        after the service I had received on
                                        occasion) seemed very high. I was also
                                        not happy they quoted it in dollars in
                                        their material, but in Euros on the
                                        disembarking slide show the night
                                        before. At the time that was a large
                                        difference in price and I felt they were
                                        taking advantage of people who really
                                        never try to figure out the currency
                                        conversion. Viking is excellent at
                                        marketing; not so great at on board
                                        service. I do want to try river cruising
                                        again though and like what I hear about
                                        Grand Circle.

                                        I'm sorry you had a bad time. I have to
                                        say that in four trips on Viking, I
                                        never had those difficulties. I could go
                                        into details, but I'll leave it there.

                                        Laurie, sorry you had such a bad time.
                                        You might also want to look at Tauck.
                                        They seem to really welcome solo
                                        travelers and I've heard lots of good
                                        things about the experiences they have.
                                        On our last cruise we got to know a nice
                                        gentleman who often ate with us as well
                                        as several others. I think it helps that
                                        Taucks ships don't have as many
                                        passengers as Viking (max 130) so tour
                                        groups are smaller and you get to meet
                                        people easier. The food has been great -
                                        especially dinner. Cost is high but all
                                        paid for well ahead of the trip
                                        including all tips, alcohol, excursions.
                                        Everything except laundry service,
                                        masseuse, boutique shopping.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        A friend just got back from a Grand
                                        Circle cruise with her sister. We
                                        compared notes and it was a more bare
                                        bones experience than Tauck but they had
                                        a good time. They liked the stateroom
                                        configuration with drop down twin beds.
                                        Good for them or singles but some
                                        couples might not like.

                                        WE have taken three river cruises (AMA)
                                        and loved each one! Were we the youngest
                                        on board? Maybe. I'm not sure why that
                                        bothers so many people! Do you think
                                        people become boring just because they
                                        pass the 60 year mark?
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        We found the experience aboard and on
                                        shore to be enchanting for the most
                                        part. We like to bracket our cruises
                                        with stays in cities like Prague or
                                        Berlin where we can spend time on our
                                        own, which makes these trips just about
                                        perfect.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        Please don't write a river cruise off
                                        your list just because other people
                                        don't find them "real" enough. "Real"
                                        can be exhausting, just as expensive and
                                        creating no more happy memories than a
                                        cruise. To each his own!

                                            people don't find them "real"
                                            enough. "Real" can be exhausting,
                                            just as expensive and creating no
                                            more happy memories than a cruise.
                                            To each his own!

                                        Welcome to the forum ASB! I'm glad
                                        you've had such good experiences on your
                                        AMA cruises. AMA looks like a good
                                        alternative to Viking.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        I think it boils down to what kind of
                                        experience you want to have. Many folks
                                        find research and planning stressful.
                                        River cruises are a great alternative
                                        for them. You pick the cruise you'd like
                                        and everything is handled from that
                                        point. On the other hand, we find
                                        researching planning and making
                                        arrangements half the fun. My wife and I
                                        have spent many a pleasant evening
                                        together poring over possibilities while
                                        enjoying a nice glass of wine. The
                                        internet has made planning much easier
                                        and foolproof.

                                        We also like the sense of adventure and
                                        the spontaneity provided by doing DIY
                                        trips. Within a general framework we
                                        provide ourselves flexibility. More than
                                        once we've abandoned the rest of the
                                        day's itinerary to spend more time
                                        exploring where we find ourselves. We
                                        once got caught up in a pub crawl in
                                        Linlithgow Scotland with a bride-to-be
                                        and her entourage as she sold kisses for
                                        her dowry. They didn't realize we were
                                        tourists and unfamiliar with the
                                        tradition. We were such good sports that
                                        they invited us to join them! So much
                                        for a quiet night back at the B&amp;B.

                                        Yes, "real" can be exhausting,
                                        especially if you plan to cram every
                                        possible sight in a minimum amount of
                                        time. However, "real" can also allow you
                                        to set your own pace. We always plan in
                                        down days (as Rick suggests) to take a
                                        break from what can become a hectic
                                        sprint from one sight to another.

                                        There's no wrong way to travel. The
                                        important thing is to get out, explore
                                        the world and see different perspectives
                                        of living.

                                        Hi Doug, I was very interested to read
                                        your "trip report". My friend and I are
                                        considering a Viking River Cruise for
                                        2017 (Basel to Amsterdam) after spending
                                        some time on our own in Switzerland.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        One of the posters indicated that
                                        tipping was mandatory. The Viking
                                        website states that it is voluntary but
                                        provides guidelines. Can you confirm if
                                        tipping was mandatory? I'd just like to
                                        know what I'm signing up for. Thanks for
                                        your report and your help!
                                    </p>

                                        Thanks for this post. We are independent
                                        travelers in our late 50s and have
                                        vaguely considered a river cruise, but I
                                        don't think most of them would be for
                                        us. On our recent trip to Vienna, we saw
                                        very large groups being herded around
                                        behind a Viking tour group sign and that
                                        was a turnoff for us. Also, I consider
                                        planning part of the fun and my husband
                                        is happy to have me do the planning.

                                    <p>Donna,</p>

                                    <p>
                                        Tipping is definitely optional. I don't
                                        know how the cruise industry works, but
                                        I imagine it is similar to restaurants
                                        where the employees depend on tips for a
                                        big part of their income.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        I based my response on what I read on
                                        cruise sites and Viking before I left. I
                                        decided to take the suggestions from
                                        Viking. We tipped 10 euros per day per
                                        person for the staff of 50 and then a
                                        separate tip for the tour director.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        The trip you are planning is the very
                                        same trip we took. Again, we had a
                                        wonderful time and I'm sure you will
                                        too!
                                    </p>

                                        Sorry, I just do not trust the cruise
                                        company to get the tips to the people
                                        that really need/deserve them. I
                                        directly tip those that have given me
                                        good service. Why end up giving the same
                                        amount to a person who gave you terrible
                                        service and to a person who gave you
                                        great service?

                                        We just returned from a month in France
                                        that include a week long Viking river
                                        cruise. I am in the process of writing a
                                        longer trip review but the short version
                                        is that we were very pleased with the
                                        Viking cruise. We have been on seven
                                        ocean cruises around Europe but this was
                                        our first river cruise. From reading
                                        many negative postings about Viking I
                                        was a little concerned. But the cruise
                                        far exceeded our expectations. Really
                                        nothing to complain about. Food was
                                        excellent and on board drink prices
                                        cheap. We found all of the included
                                        tours to be excellent. Granted there are
                                        30 plus people in the group but all the
                                        guides use the head set so it was easy
                                        to hear and your could be some distance
                                        from the guide and still have a clear
                                        understanding of what was being said. We
                                        found that we always had a long
                                        afternoon for free time and often
                                        revisited some of the sites we saw in
                                        the morning. We like it so well we
                                        bought their 2 for 1 coupons for another
                                        trip next year.

                                        as the staff worked hard.

                                        I agree with Frank; our first cruise
                                        experience of any type was a Viking
                                        cruise on the Danube and we had an
                                        excellent time! We've used Rick Steves
                                        books for all of our European travels
                                        and were a bit worried about river
                                        cruising. However, we combined it with
                                        an independent week in Slovenia and a
                                        few days post cruise in Prague and loved
                                        our "vacation within a vacation"! We
                                        felt absolutely free to join tours, go
                                        on our own, and combine the two. We met
                                        great people, enjoyed the food and wine,
                                        as well as the lectures and
                                        entertainment. We started with a couple
                                        days at an airBnB in Budapest before
                                        joining the cruise and did the same in
                                        Prague post cruise. We'll absolutely
                                        cruise with Viking again, just as we'll
                                        use Rick's great advice and do our own
                                        planning. Remember, there's more than
                                        one "right" way to experience Europe-or
                                        any new place. Keep your options open
                                        and enjoy all new experiences! When I
                                        mentioned to our family before our trip
                                        our reluctance to "follow the umbrella",
                                        our son reminded us that as a
                                        college-age backpacker in Europe, he
                                        always took the free walking tour when
                                        arriving in a new city-and usually met
                                        great people too. As Rick says, "Keep on
                                        traveling!"

                                        Bob, <br />
                                        I understand your point of view and it
                                        does make sense. However, I know there
                                        were many "behind the scenes" people,
                                        such as the deck hands and cooks, who
                                        helped provide me with a wonderful
                                        experience. I want to show my
                                        appreciation to them to.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        Speaking of them, I went out of my way
                                        to thank as many deck hands as I could.
                                        I'd see them in the crew break area on
                                        the top deck and took a minute to
                                        personally thank them. They were all
                                        appreciative and a couple remarked that
                                        taking the time to thank them meant a
                                        lot.

                                    <p>
                                        I haven't been on a Viking riving
                                        cruise, but I was on an Avalon river
                                        cruise from Nuremberg to Budapest in
                                        April 2014. I'm in my late 30s, but I
                                        think the average age of my fellow
                                        cruisers was about 65+.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        I probably won't be going on another
                                        river cruise any time soon (other than a
                                        Christmas market cruise perhaps) as I
                                        just felt it wasn't worth it. Like many
                                        posters have already stated, it was nice
                                        to be able to unpack once and have your
                                        meals already planned out for you
                                        (having white asparagus for lunch one
                                        day was really a nice treat).
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        However, cruising through the
                                        immeasurable locks in the Danube became
                                        very tedious after a while and being
                                        confined to a set schedule was another
                                        major downer (ships only have a certain
                                        amount of time at each dock). In
                                        addition, as the ships themselves can't
                                        be very wide due to the size
                                        restrictions, the ships can't offer much
                                        in terms of entertainment. I brought
                                        along a fair amount of books to read and
                                        there was a mini fitness center as well
                                        as jogging track on the upper deck, but
                                        with the shores so temptingly close
                                        alongside the ship, it was a real bummer
                                        not to be able to get off the ship and
                                        walk around.

                                        Thanks for all the input on this. I
                                        appreciate all the great ideas. We have
                                        also considered European River cruising,
                                        but will put it off for a while. We
                                        cruised on the KD line (which travels
                                        the Rhine River.) from St Goar, Germany
                                        to Assmanshausen and back. Also from St
                                        Goar to Koblenz. We saw the best of the
                                        castles on the Rhine and used our Rick
                                        Steves guide book to tell us about each
                                        mile marker along the way. We stayed in
                                        St Goar and loved that town and the
                                        ability to walk around and dine with
                                        locals. Then we took a train to Trier to
                                        start our Rick Steves tour. This w as a
                                        great way to cruise and it was very
                                        reasonable.

                                        Someone mentioned that cruising would be
                                        the way to see Alaska. I would like
                                        inform that poster that an Alaska Cruise
                                        only visits a tiny piece of Alaska. We
                                        took a cruise tour of Alaska and we
                                        "wanted more". We flew to Anchorage,
                                        rented a car and drove all over the
                                        state for two weeks. It was incredibly
                                        beautiful. It was easier than Europe
                                        because the language is English. The
                                        Alaskan people are very independent and
                                        friendly. I hope you'll see Beauty of
                                        Alaska away from the cruise ports.

                                        all the above comments and having my own
                                        experience it is clear, pick the
                                        vacation that works for you. I traveled
                                        with three friends. One friend always
                                        maps out her own trips and was
                                        frustrated with the cruise schedule. She
                                        was much happier when we spent time on
                                        our own before and after the cruise. For
                                        me I liked the customer service on
                                        Viking. The staff and food were
                                        excellent!!! My life was so busy prior
                                        to the vacation that I welcomed all the
                                        pampering, side trips and information
                                        the cruise line provided. If you have
                                        any special needs or walk slow they
                                        always have alternatives to make your
                                        vacation worry free and enjoyable.
                                        Something I noticed that was wasn't
                                        mentioned earlier was the open seating.
                                        Every meal is spent at a table of six,
                                        eight or twelve. Although I am a very
                                        out going person and love meeting new
                                        people , I found sitting with new people
                                        at every meal exhausting after awhile. I
                                        actually was happy I was travelling with
                                        four people and not just two (my husband
                                        and I) so there were more people to do
                                        the talking. I noticed after a few days,
                                        people we had sat with were waving at us
                                        to join them so I know they felt the
                                        same. All the people we met were
                                        delightful and interesting so I learned
                                        a lot but for people who aren't very
                                        social it's good to know about this
                                        piece before hand. If you travel you
                                        learn there are positive and negatives

                                        independent. It is great to have this
                                        forum to get info that will help you
                                        decide what may or may not work for you.

                                        I did the AMAwaterways Christmas market
                                        cruise last Nov 2015 on the Danube. It
                                        was wonderful. Yes I agree that the
                                        cruises are more pricey. I am going
                                        again in June 2017 (down the Rhone
                                        river) and then tacking on a RS tour
                                        when I end up in Barcelona. This price
                                        is a lot more for river boat cruisin'.
                                        But both cruises were/are work related
                                        (but at my cost). I have travelled on my
                                        own planning our vacation, school trips,
                                        and RS tours. My preference is RS tours
                                        over all. I like planning but it sure is
                                        nice to have RS do all the work. Not
                                        sure if I will do more cruises with my
                                        work. I cross that bridge later. In the
                                        meantime, I keep travelin' with Uncle
                                        Rick.
